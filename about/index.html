      <h1>About me</h1>
    </header>

    <p>I am a backend and distributed systems engineer currently based in Glasgow, UK. I am also
a gopher studying at University of Glasgow and working on multiple open source repositories, some of which are:</p>

<ul>
<li>DTSsistant - a Google Assistant app for the inhabitans of my beautiful hometown (Drobeta-Turnu Severin, Romania),
where people can get answers regarding whatever is happening around the city: events, art exhibitions,
interesting trivia about the city or the area etc.; the server is completely built in Go and is hosted on
Google App Engine, while the natural language processing and intent extraction and parsing is done through DialogFlow;
the code for the server will be available on GitHub as soon as it reaches a stable state;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nclandrei/synctube">SyncTube</a> - command line app that can sync the whole YouTube library of a user and
download everything that was either liked or added to a playlist since the last synchronization; the whole tool was
built in Go;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nclandrei/PDF-DOCX-Extractor">PDF-DOCX-Extractor</a> - web application that can parse a PDF or DOCX and
extract all images, tables and text into separate archives; the tool was built as part of the coursework at the university
using Java Spring and plain Bootstrap;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nclandrei/Palgo">Palgo</a> - Electron app for visualizing and animating common algorithms such as Dijkstra&rsquo;s
algorithm for finding the shortest path between two vertices in a graph.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the stuff I am most interested in and have the most experience with are backend development, Go, distributed
systems, Java, cloud-native apps and systems programming.</p>

<p>I have created this website mainly to contribute back to the awesome world of open source with a main focus on Go, backend development, cloud and distributed systems. Even though I do not have that much experience, I really hope that the blog posts I will be writing will help someone someday ðŸ™‚.</p>

<p>If you would like to find out more, please take a look at my <a href="link-to-CV-here">resume</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy!</p>
